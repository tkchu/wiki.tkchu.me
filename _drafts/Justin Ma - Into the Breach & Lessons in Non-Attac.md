Design Tip Summary
·Question a feature to determine its High-Level Design
·Use other games' High-Level design as inspiration
·Analyze features to streamline and polish your game
·Question every assumed feature
·Use your team's time and skills as efficiently as possible
·In a design tie-always favor the player
·If a mechanic feels odd -try flipping the script
·Use low numbers if strategic decision-making is the goal
·Worldbuilding>Storytelling (for me)

"Low-Level"vs"High-Level"Design Low Level Desian:Hiah Level Desian:
·What are the basic mechanics of the feature?·What is the purpose of a feature?
·What are the exact numbers involved with the ·How does the feature interact with the rest of
"What is the feature?"
VS
"What effect does the feature have on the player's experience?"

How do I determine"High-level Design"?
Ikeep askina questions:
·How does this design encourage players to act?
·How would the game be different without this design?
·How does this design interact with other features?

Taking Inspiration from Other Games
Instead of copvina features-copy Hiah-Level Desians":
·Keep the purpose of the mechanic but change the low-level design to fit your needs
·Provides a useful metric to judge if your low-level design is working
·The same low-level design can result in very different high-level design in different games

Use "High-Level Design"to Cut and Streamline
Use this lens to analvze all of your qame's features:
·Figure out which mechanics are actually necessary and cut the rest
·If multiple designs perform the same purpose-combine them
·Helps you become less attached to your design and let go when necessary

Question all Design Assumptions Be cautious of-"We have this feature because it's part of the aenre":
· Analyze everything that wasn't designed by you to see if it is helpful
· Helps your game be more unique
· However... sometimes the standard design is best

In a Tie-Always Favor the Player If two desians both seem ok-Pick the one that is nicest to the plaver:
·If the player can justifiably argue that the game is being unfair-it may as well be unfair
·If they fail,you want players to be mad at themselves-not at the game for being unfair
·Use this sparingly-Be nice only when it doesn't hurt your design

Flip the Script If an idea feels like it should work but is off try inverting it
·"If A then B"doesn't work? Try "If not A then not B"
·Expect GOOD result-Get BAD result->Rage quit
·Expect BAD result-Get GOOD result->Pleasant surprise

Personal Preferences-Low Numbers
Use low numbers when you want the player to make informed decisions:
·There's only so many numbers we can keep in our head at once
·Overloading the player with numbers hides the actual strategy

Personal Preferences-Worldbuilding
In Non-Narrative games I prefer worldbuildina over storytelling:
·Create a consistent universe
·Let the player experience your story
·Sometimes 'less is more'with text
